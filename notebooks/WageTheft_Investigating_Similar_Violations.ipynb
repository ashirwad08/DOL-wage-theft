    "# Investigating Similar Violation Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a hypothetical scenario where the WHD investigator has just concluded investigating [say] some firm that's classified in the *Breakfast Cereal Manufacturing Facility* group under *6 digit NAICS* **311230**, in the *Santa Rosa, CA* Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). This firm has been found guilty of certain types of violations that are concerning and that affect at-risk populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the scenario above, and having only the main DOL WHD historical investigations dataset at one's disposal, how might the DOL weed out similar patterns of violations. The obvious way is to look into *similar* firms under the same industry code for similar patterns of violations. But what if there were very similar sorts of violations occuring in some other industry, and in another region... there'd be no way of knowing this unless there is some sort of *anecdotal evidence*. Well, that's until now:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider building a big vector space where each vector is a NAICS6 + MSA (specific industry sub-group in an MSA) with information around the violation *severity* metric (calculated in the previous section) along with some other specific attributes. Upon computing an appropriate *distance* between each such vector in this multi-dimensional space, we could get a sense of how *similar* one vector is to every other vector. This, in essence, translates into similar violation patterns between industry groups across MSAs in the *known* dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Great, this is progress. But this doesn't quite solve the problem of *observation bias* in the dataset - the investigator is able to understand similarity in violation patterns amongst known violators in known industry sub-groups. In our example, this means all other known 6-digit NAICS violators. **But what about the unknown industry sub-groups out there?** If we make certain assumptions on demographics, class, sex, education, income status, household, it's entirely possible that the resulting class of workforce **is** encountering similar violations in some other industry that's not in the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's one little trick on how we might discover other violators. The trick lies in building our vector space *up* in the industry hierarchy, for example, at the 3-digit NAICS level. Here, *Breakfast Cereal Manufacturing Facility* is grouped into *Food Manufacturing* under the 3-digit code: 311. The following is key for the exercise below:  \n",
    "\n",
    "> We build the similarity space on the assumption that a higher hierarchy of the NAICS group captures certain characteristics of workforce populations within that group.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This way, if we're able to identify target sub-groups of a *similar* violator at the 3-digit NAICS, we can drill down to sub-groups that are not in the dataset to watch for similar violation patterns."
