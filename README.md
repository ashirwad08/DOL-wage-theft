# Investigating Worker Exploitation in California  

Breaking down worker exploitation and wage theft using the Department of Labor's *Wage and Hour Complicance* dataset [here](http://ogesdw.dol.gov/views/data_summary.php).

Next Steps / Nice to Haves:   
* At least half of Metropolitan Statistical Area employment workforce statistics not found. Perform analysis at state level if no other sources located.  
* A supervised learning exercise precludes the inclusion of demographic data for the workforce. Still have not found a datasource that provides demographic data by NAICS industry group. This'll be a major leap forward in the analysis, once located.  
* Current WHD dataset includes violations uncovered over a 25-30 year time span, per investigation. These numbers will have to be averaged out when being compared to annual workforce survey numbers for a given year, unless a concentrated effort is made to obtain a year-over-year NAICS group workforce statistics from the Census Bureau or the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
